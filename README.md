# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the game.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the game logic.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the game.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Click on a cell in the grid to place your mark (X or O).
4. Players take turns until one player wins or the game is a draw.
